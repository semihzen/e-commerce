# E-COMMERCE WEB SÄ°TE 
   
   
 ### I developed an e-commerce website for sports equipment. While developing this site, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js (Express), and SQL. I also added an admin panel to the site. Only users with the username admin@admin.com can access this admin panel. This admin panel allows for adding, deleting, and editing products.

To make a purchase on the site, users must register. Once registered, users can add products to their cart, delete them, adjust quantities, and place orders. You can track your orders from your profile.

For this site, I used MySQL as the database because it seems more adaptable and faster. While developing this site, I learned how to use Node.js and how to benefit from the Express framework.
